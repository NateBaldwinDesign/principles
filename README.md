# Axiom
## Create typographically proportional interfaces based on design principles

Incorporate design principles easily and incorporate them throughout your entire web interface.

Axiom builds stylesheets based on a single JSON file `principles.json`. Principles of design can be easily entered by designers, which are then incorporated as SASS variables and mixins. 

Font sizes, line heights, padding, and margins are all based on font size, typographic scales and ratios.
